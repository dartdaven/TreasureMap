# TreasureMap

#### Hashmap

Create an associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys. Search, insertion, and removal of elements should have average constant-time complexity. Having multiple elements per one key is not allowed, but don't forget about resolving collisions.

You can use [std::unordered_map](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map) as an example of such a container.

Supported operations:
* access element by key
* insert element
* emplace element
* remove element
* check elements number
* check if an element exists in the container
* set custom hash function


#### Tree
Create a sorted associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys. Search, removal, and insertion operations should have logarithmic complexity on average. Having multiple elements per one key is not allowed.
You can use [std::map](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map) as an example of such a container.

Supported operations:
* access element by key
* insert element
* emplace element
* remove element
* check elements number
* check if an element exists in the container
